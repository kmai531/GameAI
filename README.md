General Instructions:

Navigate to the specific folder.
If any *.o files are present, clean up using make clean.
Compile the program using Makefile with make.
Run the compiled program: ./main.

Homework1: Basic implementation of boid movement [link](./Homework1/README.md)

- Velocity Matching: Boids adjust their speed to match nearby boids.
- Align & Arrive: Boids head in a uniform direction.
- Wander: Random movement pattern simulation.
- Flocking: Collective behavior mimicking something similar to birds in nature.
